Decrypt offline windows passwords, chrome and firefox

Just exe run.py pass the -d to the directory where you have mounted the offline Windows files and give the user password (-p) to decrypt the files. 

The idea of this is to merge a couple of tools I use, and make it easier and faster to use them, just give those two parameters, and the program will find the correct paths itself.

If you have a blank password, you can set that with -p ''
